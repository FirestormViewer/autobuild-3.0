# Autobuild

**Autobuild** is a framework for building packages and for managing the
dependencies of a package on other packages. It provides a common
interface to configuring and building any package, but it is not a
build system like make or cmake. You will still need platform-specific
make, cmake, or project files to configure and build your
library. Autobuild will, however, allow you invoke these commands and
package the product with a common interface.

*Important: Linden Lab Autobuild is not the same as or derived from GNU
Autobuild, but they are similar enough to cause confusion.*
